# HR Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an HR dataset to gain insights into employee salary distribution, performance, recruitment sources, departments, and gender-based trends.  
The goal is to clean, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data to support better HR-related decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains detailed employee information related to:
- Salary and compensation
- Department and position
- Gender
- Recruitment source
- Performance scores
- Employment status

Before analysis, the dataset was **cleaned and preprocessed** to handle missing values, inconsistent entries, and data formatting issues.

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Handling missing and null values
- Removing unnecessary columns
- Correcting data types
- Standardizing categorical variables
- Preparing data for visualization and analysis

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA focuses on understanding salary trends, performance, and workforce distribution using various visualizations.

### Key Analysis Performed:
- **Salary Analysis**
  - Highest salary vs lowest salary
  - Department-wise salary distribution
  - Gender-wise salary comparison

- **Recruitment Analysis**
  - Salary comparison based on source of recruitment
  - Distribution of employees by recruitment source

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Analysis of employee performance scores
  - Performance distribution across departments

- **Workforce Insights**
  - Gender distribution
  - Department-wise employee count

---

## 📈 Data Visualization
The following visualization techniques were used:
- Bar plots
- Count plots
- Comparative charts for salary and performance
- Categorical distribution plots

Libraries used for visualization include **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
